take two pointer starting from head 
make one faster and another slower 
faster will jump 2 step and slower jump 1 step 
when they both point at one place their is cycle 

class Node:
    def __init__(self,Value=None):
        self.value= None
        self.next = None

    def cycle(self):
        Node1 = Node(1)
        Node2 = Node(2)
        Node3 = Node(3)
        Node4 = Node(4)

        Node1.next = Node2
        Node2.next = Node3
        Node3.next = Node4
        Node4.next = Node3

        slow = fast = Node1

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:
                
                return True
        return False
